 * You have experience tackling new, messy datasets, and structuring them for quick analysis and insights; you understand the importance of establishing data standards and unifying multiple sources of data to track program progress and optimize work over time.
 * You are comfortable communicating the results of analysis to a wide range of stakeholders, including through routine reporting and leveraging data visualization tools like Looker Studio, Looker, Tableau, or Periscope.
 * You can turn independent analysis projects into sustainable, documented workflows, and have experience building systems that can be used across teams and are designed with longevity in mind.
 * You are curious, collaborative, and humble – ready to work with a diverse, distributed team to solve interesting problems together.
   
   

Additional Useful Skills And Qualifications


 * You have experience using dbt.
 * You have experience working with political data like state voter files, election results, or data on voter, volunteer, or donor engagement.
 * You have direct experience with voter databases and outreach software such as VAN/ Votebuilder, Scale to Win, or Reach.
 * You have an understanding of how to (and how not to) use predictive modeling, such as Turnout and Support scores.

Summary

We're looking for a data-savvy, curious, and adaptable individual to join our Analytics team as a Data & Analytics Specialist. This person will take the reins on daily data operations - managing performance dashboards, wrangling data from media and fundraising platforms, ensuring consistency across our reporting workflows - while also supporting the broader transformation of how our agency leverages data, automation, and AI.

This is a foundational role in a rapidly evolving area of the agency. As part of a small but forward-thinking team, you'll not only be responsible for data integrity and insights delivery, but will also contribute to piloting new tools, workflows, and ideas that will shape the future of nonprofit marketing and agency operations.

 * Learn and test AI tools that can improve agency workflows - particularly for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

 * Bring a strong learning mindset - this role is expected to evolve as the agency's AI and data strategy matures.
   
   

Required

Skills & Qualifications

 * Familiarity with AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Zapier) and how they can support workflows, analysis, or automations.
 * Attention to detail and a strong sense of data accuracy and QA.
 * Clear communicator - able to explain data trends and inconsistencies in human terms.

As our tools evolve, so will this role - and we're looking for someone excited to grow with it.

This role will support the development and evolution of Carta Healthcare’s portfolio of registry-driven products, ensuring the accurate abstraction, analysis, and interpretation of clinical data in ways that drive continuous quality improvement.

As a Clinical Registry Data Analyst, you’ll work closely with clinical stakeholders, product managers, and engineering teams to validate clinical content, refine registry data flows, and optimize abstraction tools. You will bring experience with chart abstraction, a deep understanding of EHR workflows, and a collaborative spirit to help shape clinical data tools powered by LLMs and AI.

Responsibilities


 * Apply clinical judgement and domain knowledge to assess patient-level data, registry metrics, and abstraction quality
 * Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define clinical registry data requirements, identify data quality issues, and propose solutions
 * Monitor and improve data abstraction processes through the use of dashboards, KPIs, and continuous improvement methodologies
 * Conduct root cause analysis, process mapping, and lead PDSA cycles to enhance abstraction quality and workflow reliability
 * Work alongside engineering and research teams to classify error types, define AI model failure modes, and recommend mitigation strategies
 * Support prompt evaluation and tuning for large language models in clinical abstraction contexts
 * Champion quality, accuracy, and usability of registry data products in service of clinicians and data stewards
 * Analyze electronic health record data and measure data availability and quality for clinical registry submission

Data Analysis


 * Fluency working with datasets to evaluate abstraction metrics like precision, recall, and inter-rater reliability
 * Produce comprehensive analytical reports to communicate abstraction quality trends, AI model performance, and recommendations for remediation. Present findings clearly and concisely to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
 * Define and maintain a structured error taxonomy to classify model or abstraction failures by type, severity, and likely root cause. This structured approach enables targeted QA efforts and informs both technical and process improvements.
 * Collaborate with engineering, product, and clinical stakeholders to perform detailed error analysis. Trace abstraction errors to specific documentation patterns, ambiguous question logic, or misaligned model outputs.
   
   

Continuous Improvement


 * Proficiency with analyzing abstraction performance using data dashboards and quality metrics
 * Experience with root cause analysis, process mapping, and PDSA cycle execution
   
   

Track record of driving improvements in clinical workflows or data operations

Prompt Engineering

Exposure to large language models and an understanding of prompt design, response tuning, and output evaluation in clinical contexts

Why we love Carta Healthcare, and why you will too!


 * Working on a new, challenging problem space with LLMs/AI/Healthcare
 * Industry leading products
 * Work hard, and have fun doing it
 * Work alongside some of the most talented and dedicated teammates
